Almost any electrophysiology study of awake behaving animals relies on a battery of standard analyses.
Raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms aligned to stimuli and behavior provide a snapshot visual description of neural activity. Similarly, tuning curves are the most standard way to characterize how neurons encode stimuli or behavioral preferences. With increasing popularity of population recordings, maximum-likelihood decoders based on tuning models are becoming part of this standard.

Yet, virtually every lab relies on a set of in-house analysis scripts to go from raw data to summaries. We want to change this status quo in order to enable easier sharing, better reproducibility and fewer bugs.

Spykes is a collection of Python tools to make the visualization and analysis of neural data easy and reproducible.

At present, spykes comes with three classes:
- ```NeuroVis``` helps you plot beautiful spike rasters and peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs).
- ```PopVis``` helps you plot population summaries of PSTHs as normalized averages or heat maps.
- ```NeuroPop``` helps you estimate tuning curves of neural populations and decode stimuli from population vectors with maximum-likelihood decoding.

```Spykes``` deliberately does not aim to provide tools for spike sorting or file i/o with popular electrophysiology formats, but only aims to fill the missing niche for neural data analysis and easy visualization. For file i/o, see [Neo](http://neuralensemble.org/neo/) and [OpenElectrophy](http://neuralensemble.org/OpenElectrophy/). For spike sorting, see [Klusta](http://klusta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Documentation, tutorials and examples are coming soon! Check out the notebooks for now.

### Dependencies

Already distributed with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/).
- ```NumPy``` >= 1.6.1
- ```SciPy``` >= 0.14
- ```Matplotlib``` >= 1.5

We also use ```Numba``` to optimize certain functions. We recommend the latest stable version (>= 0.26.0).

```bash
$ pip install numba
```

### Datasets

The example notebooks use two real datasets. Instructions for downloading these datasets are included in the notebooks. We recommend [deepdish](https://github.com/uchicago-cs/deepdish) for reading the HDF5 datafile.
