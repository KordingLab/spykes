Spykes
==================================

Almost any electrophysiology study of neural spiking data relies on a battery of standard analyses.
Raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms aligned to stimuli and behavior provide a snapshot visual description of neural activity. Similarly, tuning curves are the most standard way to characterize how neurons encode stimuli or behavioral preferences. With increasing popularity of population recordings, maximum-likelihood decoders based on tuning models are becoming part of this standard.

Yet, virtually every lab relies on a set of in-house analysis scripts to go from raw data to summaries. We want to improve this status quo in order to enable easier sharing, better reproducibility and fewer bugs.

Spykes is a collection of Python tools to make the visualization and analysis of neural data easy and reproducible.

At present, spykes comes with four classes:

- ```NeuroVis``` helps you plot beautiful spike rasters and peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs).
- ```PopVis``` helps you plot population summaries of PSTHs as normalized averages or heat maps.
- ```NeuroPop``` helps you estimate tuning curves of neural populations and decode stimuli from population vectors with maximum-likelihood decoding.
- ```STRF``` helps you estimate spatiotemporal receptive fields.

``Spykes`` deliberately does not aim to provide tools for spike sorting or file i/o with popular electrophysiology formats, but only aims to fill the missing niche for neural data analysis and easy visualization. For file i/o, see `Neo <http://neuralensemble.org/neo/>`__ and `OpenElectrophy <http://neuralensemble.org/OpenElectrophy/>`__. For spike sorting, see `Klusta <http://klusta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
